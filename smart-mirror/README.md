```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-python.git
   cd smart-mirror
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the smart mirror application, execute the following command:

```
python src/main.py
```

The application will initialize the webcam and start tracking faces. Make sure your webcam is connected and functioning properly.

## Dependencies
